# Web Scraping for ESG Data

## What is Web Scraping?

It has two parts: web and scraping.

The web is HTML accessed over the Internet.

Scraping involves:

- extracting data from that HTML,
- cleaning that data,
- storing that data for later processing by other tools (e.g., Large Language Models, Excel...)

## In Scope?

Web scraping of tabular data into Excel using Pandas.

## Out of Scope?

- Direct API queries.
- Web scraping of non-tabular data using Beautiful Soup.
- Use authentication using e.g., automation tools like Selenium.
- Feeding data into AI tools.
- Visualizing data.
